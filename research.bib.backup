  abstract = {Racial gaps in teacher performance ratings have emerged nationwide across newly implemented educator evaluation systems. Using Chicago Public Schools data, we quantify the magnitude of the race gap in teachers’ classroom observation scores, examine its determinants, and describe the potential implications for teacher diversity. Between-school differences explain most of the race gap and within-school classroom-level differences—poverty, incoming achievement, and prior-year misconduct of a teacher’s students—explain the remainder of the race gap. Teachers’ value-added scores explain none of the race gap. Leveraging within-teacher variation in the teacher–evaluator race match, we find that racial mismatch does not influence observation scores. Adjusting observation scores for classroom and school context will generate more equitable ratings of teacher performance and mitigate potential adverse consequences for teacher diversity.}

abstract="Teachers' classroom behavior testing can help the understand the learning situation of students, feedback the teaching effect, and formulate corresponding measures to help. Traditional evaluation methods rely on manual testing, which is time-consuming and lacks objectivity. This article suggests a new approach to analyze the behavior of teachers by using the human skeleton posture. This method first uses the popular human posture gesture estimation technology to obtain the skeleton joint node of the teacher in the teaching process, and then remove several of the joint nodes that have a weaker effect on the classification of teachers in class. Finally, a convolutional neural network was designed to classify the teacher's behavior based on the skeleton joint nodes and confidence obtained from processing the input. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of the method helps the dynamic management and evaluation of classroom teachers' behavior.",

abstract = {Teachers serve as transmitters of cultural knowledge and play a crucial role in ongoing development and continuity of human society. Analyzing their behavior can assist educators in identifying their strengths and weaknesses within the classroom, thereby enhancing their teaching skills and methods. With the development of artificial intelligence, it is possible to automatically analyze teachers' behavior in the classroom by offering timely feedback and suggestions to improve teaching strategies. In this paper, we propose an action classification method based on human skeletal posture to analyze teacher-behavior in the classroom. First, by using the HRNet pose estimation algorithm to extract teacher skeleton information as features, the algorithm could remove redundant information in images and accurately reflect the teacher's posture. Second, by considering the relative positions of skeletal points, we establish a set of quantifiable indicators to analyze the interrelationships among these points and then obtain the teacher's local posture. Finally, relying on the local posture obtained based on the indicators, we encode and classify common behaviors of teachers in the classroom. The approach's effectiveness is evidenced by experimental results, which enables dynamic management and assessment of teacher behavior in educational environments.}

In this paper, we perform a systematic and recent literature review on this topic, from 2000 to 2014, covering a selection of 193 papers that were searched from six major scientific publishers. The selected papers were classified into three main subjects: detection techniques, datasets and applications. The detection techniques were divided into four categories (initialization, tracking, pose estimation and recognition). The list of datasets includes eight examples (e.g., Hollywood action). Finally, several application areas were identified, including human detection, abnormal activity detection, action recognition, player modeling and pedestrian detection. Our analysis provides a road map to guide future research for designing automatic visual human behavior detection systems.}
