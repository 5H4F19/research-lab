This thesis presents a novel approach to evaluate pedagogical outcomes using audio, video, and linguistic analysis. By integrating multimodal data sources, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of student engagement and learning effectiveness. The proposed methodology leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze audio cues, facial expressions, and linguistic patterns during educational activities. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this approach to enhance traditional evaluation methods, offering deeper insights into student performance and areas for improvement. This research contributes to the field of educational technology by introducing innovative tools for educators to better understand and support their students' learning journeys.
