# Abstract
Teacher performance evaluation is a cornerstone of educational quality assurance. This study investigates the correlation between a multimodal evaluation system and traditional student feedback, focusing on reliability, validity, and practical implications.

# Introduction
The evaluation of teacher performance is critical for educational quality assurance. Traditional student feedback methods are often subjective and limited in scope. Recent advancements in multimodal systems offer more objective and comprehensive evaluation methods.

# Methodology
This study employs a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection. Data sources include audio, video, transcripts, and student feedback. Statistical and thematic analyses are used to identify correlations and patterns.

# Results
The multimodal system demonstrated higher reliability and validity compared to traditional feedback. Key findings include strong correlations between multimodal metrics and student engagement levels.

# Conclusion
This study highlights the potential of multimodal systems to complement traditional feedback methods. Future work will focus on addressing challenges such as data privacy and algorithmic bias.
